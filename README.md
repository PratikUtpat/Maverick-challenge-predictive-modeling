Predictive Modeling (classification) - Predicting which kind of plant we can grow at different locations depending on the environment.

Objective:
To predict which kind of plant we can grow at different locations depending on the environment.

Problem statement:
1. Create a report on key insights derived from Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Create a multi-class prediction model to predict the species of plant which will survive in the neighborhood of a given environment.
3. Create key segments for all the plants (train + test) based on the average sunlight received throughout the day and their distance from waterbody to identify which 
segments of plants are getting enough sunlight and water vs which ones are not. This will help in mobilizing resources to track growth of trees appropriately.

Steps/Approach:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing, 2A. handling outliers ( imputation,Removal )
3. Data Engineering
4. Data Preparation for Predictive Modeling
5. Classification Model Predictions (at least 3 different predictive models) with hyperparameter tuning.
6. Comparison of model using performance KPIs, Training & Testing Time
7. Final predictive model recommendation
